==============

All my code for CSE491 - 002 - Large Scale Data Analysis

Here I've included the Twitter API stuff handed to us in class,
presumably from https://github.com/themattharris/tmhOAuth,
and I'll be organizing my code by folder for now.

Maybe I'll add branches for each assignment later (lazy).

If you want to keep track of this repo, it's at
https://github.com/firesburnsmup/bigdata-cse491, and the working example of
this code is at www.cse.msu.edu/~fires/bigdata/

I figured I oughtta just give you this information up front, all in one spot,
to make it easier for me to handin my homework and such. Besides, handin doesn't
let me provide a directory structure (not straight-up, anyway. I'd have to .zip
it, and I've gotten yelled at by professors for doing that before), so this
allows you to see the directory structure and the files themselves.
